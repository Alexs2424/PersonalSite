  <h1 class="name">Ideation and Prototyping</h1>
  <h2 class="nyu_subtitle">Main Project</h2>
  <p class="text">I want to reinvent the way people listen to music. The UI that we've used to listen to music hasn't <br />
  changed in 20 years but, our consumption, devices, and the way we get our music has. This is a little confusing<br />
  because I created a <a href="http://noisehub.co">social network for music, called NoiseHub.</a> The idea to change<br />
  the way people listen to music happened shortly after I moved to NYC (at the same time classes started). This will live<br />
  in a brand new tab in the app. It will be prototyped as a second app until it's ready to be added to the social network app.</p>

        <h2>Planning the project</h2>
        <p>I took this week to plan out what I needed for the camera recognition, and how the entire<br /> 
        app would interface with the signs and pictures I would be using. Before I create the other<br />
        pieces of the project, I needed to know what to layout and how the user's where going to interact.</p>

        <h2>Gathering Recources Pt. 1</h2>
        <p>This week I took some preliminary pictures with my smartphone of Subway signs, MTA cards, <br />
        and other Subway pictures to start to crop them and see if the phone could pick them up in AR. <br />
        I was also paying attention closely to detail in the statiions because some of the signs are not<br />
        always in the best visual seen place.</p> 
        <h4>Starting Images for Jay-St Metrotech Station</h4>

        <h2>Gathering Recources Pt. 2</h2>
        <p>I started cropping photos in a way that we could make 9/10 signs in every subway<br />
        scannable. The photos need to be original and recognizeable. The MTA has similar graphic<br />
        language throughout everything in the subway, so we can do a quick test on how the graphics can <br />
        recognized and pull information. So I started working on a prototype using the MetroCard to see if<br />
        the phone can scan a target and get information.</p> 
        <h4>Cropped Image for Recognition, So that All Signs Will Be Recognizeable</h4>

        <h2>Proof Of Concept with Augmented Reality</h2>
        <p>I wanted to start the development for the project, to make the common graphics used throughout the <br />
        MTA's materials. I built a Unity project with Vuforia Cloud Recognition Services and trained it to recognize<br />
        the common MTA card. This will be really easy to build off of for the subway signs inside. Shows that the technology<br />
        is useful and totally doable.
        </p>
        <h4>Cropped training AR recognition image</h4>
        <img src="images/metrocard.jpeg" width="400px" height="282px" alt="metrocard image" />
        <p>This was cropped like this because it couldn't have anything behind in the scene. If you had some of the scene in <br />
        the background then you could only find it once you were in that scene from that specific angle. This was the actual picture<br />
        used to train the image recognition in the app. This is a proof of concept before I move to signs in the subway for next week.</p>

        <h2>Scavenging Stations Data</h2>
        <p>The MTA has certain data standards they want anyone using their API to uphold. I started to go through the registration process<br />
        The data is pretty overwhelming and they have more than just subway data, they have LIRR, and public buses. (Practically <br />
        anything form of transportation in NYC) It's a lot to make sense of, and I've started to go through it so I can connect it <br />
        to the App via RESTAPI asking only what I need and in the form of a JSON response. Google also has their transit API which is now<br />
        apart of the MTA database. <a href="http://datamine.mta.info/">Data Mine @ MTA</a> </p>

        <h2>Starting Use with GTFS</h2>
        <p>This proved to be more difficult than I first thought. In order to get the mta data from their database it's delivered from protocols.<br />
        They're kind of tricky to work with because they're not desinged for any specific language or framework. It also took a long time to get a response<br />
        from the MTA regarding my registration key. I first signed up and looked at all the guides for working with the protocols. It's hard to understand <br />
        so I went through the documentation and examples to understand how to work with the data.</p>

        <h2>Official API Key</h2>
        <p>This week I recieved a key to gather real data from the Subway API. Each subway line gets new and individual data sets that are sent to my <br />
        service. Without the protocols in a language the data it sends back is unreadable and confusing –– you can't parse it in a traditional format. <br />
        Which is super annoying to work with - no strings until the data is passed through the protocol. I have to run it through a python or use a C#<br />
        script library in order to work with the augmented reality project I setup in Unity. </p>

        <h2>Making Protocols Work within Unity</h2>
        <p>The framework that I use in Unity to send/retrieve requests from is WWW. It's a basic framework and can't do as much post-processing on the <br />
        request as much as I would like. I started to install the Protocol buffer for C# into my unity project. This should help get the information from <br /> 
        the data so it doesn't look like gibberish. Unity's code isn't easy to work with especially for me because I'm used to working with full-scale languages<br />
        where Unity's version of C# is just scripting so it doesn't have full access or functionality. It's taking me some time to get the data into my project <br />
        correctly. It also doesn't help that the MTA has weird data attributes and working in Unity.</p>
