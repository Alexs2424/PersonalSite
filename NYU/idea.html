  <h2 class="nyu_subtitle">Creative Output Schedule</h2>
  <p class="text">I'm going to post weekly based on my creation in class on one of these projects every friday. <br />
     I would like to post it here on my personal website.</p>

        <h2>Planning the project</h2>
        <p>I took this week to plan out what I needed for the camera recognition, and how the entire<br /> 
        app would interface with the signs and pictures I would be using. Before I create the other<br />
        pieces of the project, I needed to know what to layout and how the user's where going to interact.</p>

        <h2>Gathering Recources Pt. 1</h2>
        <p>This week I took some preliminary pictures with my smartphone of Subway signs, MTA cards, <br />
        and other Subway pictures to start to crop them and see if the phone could pick them up in AR. <br />
        I was also paying attention closely to detail in the statiions because some of the signs are not<br />
        always in the best visual seen place.</p> 
        <h4>Starting Images for Jay-St Metrotech Station</h4>
        <img src="images/gather.jpeg" width="600px" height="450px" alt="subway sign for F, A, and C trains" />
        <img src="images/gather1.jpeg" width="600px" height="450px" alt="exit sign to myrtle promenade" /> 
      <li>Sept 28</li>
          <h2>Gathering Recources Pt. 2</h2>
          <p>I started cropping photos in a way that we could make 9/10 signs in every subway<br />
          scannable. The photos need to be original and recognizeable. The MTA has similar graphic<br />
          language throughout everything in the subway, so we can do a quick test on how the graphics can <br />
          recognized and pull information. So I started working on a prototype using the MetroCard to see if<br />
          the phone can scan a target and get information.</p> 
          <h4>Cropped Image for Recognition, So that All Signs Will Be Recognizeable</h4>

          <h2>Proof Of Concept with Augmented Reality</h2>
          <p>I wanted to start the development for the project, to make the common graphics used throughout the <br />
          MTA's materials. I built a Unity project with Vuforia Cloud Recognition Services and trained it to recognize<br />
          the common MTA card. This will be really easy to build off of for the subway signs inside. Shows that the technology<br />
          is useful and totally doable.
          </p>
          <h4>Cropped training AR recognition image</h4>
          <img src="images/metrocard.jpeg" width="400px" height="282px" alt="metrocard image" />
          <p>This was cropped like this because it couldn't have anything behind in the scene. If you had some of the scene in <br />
          the background then you could only find it once you were in that scene from that specific angle. This was the actual picture<br />
          used to train the image recognition in the app. This is a proof of concept before I move to signs in the subway for next week.</p>
