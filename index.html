  <p class="bio">My father passed away when I was six years old. What I learned from him passing was that I want<br/>
     to defy the odds and people's expectations. I want to change the world and I have a certain force<br />
     in me that never stops. This force has allowed me to pursue my passion of impacting people through<br />
     technology by learning to create iOS apps. I have created eight apps to date, ranging from a <br />
     social network for music, education apps using iBeacons, and a running calculator. My passion has<br />
     also fueled my interest in meeting new people, traveling to the west, and to start taking those first<br />
     steps in impacting people's lives. <br /><br />I cannot wait to work and meet you to see all the amazing ideas we have and things we will create.</p>
